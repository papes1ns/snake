# snake

It's the classical snake game.
The objective is to earn the highest score humanily possible.
Score is synonymous to the amount of candy the snake consumes.
It's game over as soon as the snake collides with a wall or itself.
Snake is constanly slithering unless game is paused (p keypress) or is game over.
The snakes slither speed increases as the score increments.

## Cool, but why though?

While perusing the RequireJS docs an urge occured to create an object-oriented javascript program.
This is how I in visioned OOP javascript code. It's functional and most importantly was fun to make.
